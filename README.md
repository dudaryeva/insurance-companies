**1. Challenges This Dashboard Solves**

This dashboard addresses several pain points in the insurance industry:
- Lack of transparency – simplifies complex financial indicators (premiums, payouts, solvency, profitability) into clear visuals.
- Comparing companies – allows benchmarking between multiple insurance companies across different classes (life vs. non-life insurance).
- Monitoring solvency & risk – tracks the solvency ratio to identify financially stable vs. risky insurers.
- Regulatory & compliance needs – regulators or auditors can quickly verify if insurers meet solvency and payout standards.
- Data overload – condenses large raw data tables into simple KPI cards, gauges, and charts.

**2. Key Benefits – Why This Dashboard Matters**

- Quick insights at a glance – executives can instantly see premiums, payouts, ratios, and profit without reading reports.
- Better decision-making – supports risk assessment, investment choices, or identifying strong/weak market players.
- Performance tracking – shows payout ratios and profitability per insurer → useful for internal performance review.
- Customer trust – helps insurers demonstrate reliability (e.g., payout ratio transparency).
- Segmentation by insurance type – splits life vs. non-life, making it clear which business line drives results.
- Benchmarking tool – compare competitors side by side to spot leaders and laggards.

**3. Who Needs This?**

This dashboard would be valuable to multiple stakeholders:
- Insurance company executives (CEO, CFO, Risk Officers) – to monitor financial health and profitability.
- Regulators (e.g., National Bank of Ukraine, insurance supervisory bodies) – to check solvency and payout compliance.
- Investors & shareholders – to assess company strength and market competitiveness.
- Actuaries & financial analysts – to model risks and evaluate loss ratios.
- Brokers & partners – to choose reliable insurers to work with.
- Business development & strategy teams – to identify opportunities in specific insurance segments.
